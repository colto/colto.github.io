<!--Work--><article id="work"><h2 class="major">Work</h2><span class="image main"><img src="/images/work.jpg" alt="Work" /></span><p>I currently work for<a href="https://www.grailed.com/" target="_blank"> Grailed</a> as a Senior Ruby Engineer. My current responsibilities include building and maintaining a suite of robust APIs and microservices, large platform upgrades, removing tech debt, refactoring and optimizing our current suite of apps, pairing with and teaching more junior engineers, and architecting new features.</p><p>I began programming over a decade ago as an intern for a local startup. Since then, I've spent a few years organizing a regional Ruby conference, built a sneaker-head lottery system, and cleaned up a code base to handle the traffic of one of the largest ever Shark Tank deals. I've had an eventful and rewarding career, and look forward to what the future has in store.</p></article>
